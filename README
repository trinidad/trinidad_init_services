Trinidad init services
===============

Trinidad's init services library based on Apache Commons Daemon and JRuby-jsvc. Works on Unix and Windows systems.

Installation
============

$ jruby -S gem install trinidad_init_services

When the gem is installed the user must launch the installation process:

    $ jruby -S trinidad_init_service

This installer guides you through the configuration process and generates a
init.d script if you are on a unix system or creates the service if you are
on a windows box.

You can optionally provide a configuration file to the trinidad_init_service
command.  An example configuration file might look like this:

    app_path: "/home/myuser/app"
    trinidad_options: "-e production"
    jruby_home: "/opt/jruby"
    ruby_compat_version: RUBY1_8
    trinidad_name: Trinidad
    jsvc_path: "/usr/bin/jsvc"
    java_home: "/opt/java"
    output_path: "/etc/init.d"
    pid_file: "/tmp/trinidad.pid"
    log_file: "/tmp/trinidad.log"

You can then run the installer like so:

    $ jruby -S trinidad_init_service trinidad_init_config.yml

If any of the required options are not provided in the configuration file, then the installer will prompt you
for them.

Unix
====

  Execution
  =========

  When the installation process finishes you can use the script trinidad-daemon.sh
  generated to launch the server as a daemon with the options start|stop|restart,
  i.e:

      $ /etc/init.d/trinidad restart

Windows
=======

  Execution
  =========

  Open the `Services` panel under `Administrative Tools` and look for a
  service called `Trinidad`.

Running as a Non-Root User
============================

By default, the Trinidad server process will run as the same user that ran the `/etc/init.d/trinidad start` command.  But the service can be configured to run Trinidad as a different user.  There are two mechanisms for this, and they are mutually exclusive.

The prefered method is the `run_user:` attribute in the configuration YAML (or it's corresponding prompt value).  For example:

    app_path: "/home/myuser/app"
    trinidad_options: "-e production"
    jruby_home: "/opt/jruby"
    run_user: myuser
    ...

This can be used to run the server as a non-root user (it essentailly invokes the JSVC command with `sudo -u run_user ...`). 
On some platforms, however, you may be required to use the JSVC `-user` argument.  This can only be configured with the YAML file.  It is a boolean flag that like can be set like this:

    app_path: "/home/myuser/app"
    trinidad_options: "-e production"
    jruby_home: "/opt/jruby"
    jsvc_user: true
    ...

The `run_user` and `jsvc_user` options are mutually exclusive, and the `run_user` takes precedence.
